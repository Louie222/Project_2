###### Launch

The project has minimum hardware requirements and works on any device. 
The link will take you to our web application. The website tells you who we are, what we do and how to contact us.

While browsing through the restaurants, for your amusement, you will be able to amuse yourself with some of the “dad jokes”.

Now, you can make an account with our app by signing up with us, the moment you sign up you will be logged in. 

You can view a list of restaurants with the location, type of restaurant it is- e.g. If it is a Café or a Restaurant and if it has an outdoor or indoor play area feature. 

There is a read more button under each of the restaurant cards. 

When you click on read more, it takes you to the next page. The page now will display the play area of the restaurant displaying a description of the restaurant with the link of the actual restaurant if you want to view the restaurants details. 

Below, you will be able to find the location on the map.



Now you can see the reviews made by customers with star ratings displaying next to it with the date and time stamp.


If you choose to write a review and or give a rating, you will need to be sign up or log in.



Each restaurant card has a read more button.
When the gallery tab is clicked, it shows you a list of restaurants in Perth, which shows the location of the restaurant, type of food offered and if it is an outdoor or indoor play equipment restaurant.  You will find a little read me button displayed on each restaurant card. 

When the read me, button is clicked it takes you to a new page where you will see a picture of the play area at that restaurant and a brief description next to it. 
Below the informative box you will see the location of that restaurant.
the gallery is clicked on, it directs you to that restaurant’s webpage, where you can look up for more information. 

You can leave reviews in the review section. 

The location map helps you locate the restaurant by displaying the address with a marker.


Project Status

We are working on implementing a review feature, where users can use filters to narrow down search based on location, update more restaurants, add favourite restaurant, and view it when they have logged in.
