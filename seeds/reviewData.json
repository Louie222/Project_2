Food was amazing and very friendly staff. The fish ponds were amazing and the kids loved looking at the fish. Loved it!!",

It's a bit pricey but there are lots of fresh ingredients and good flavour combos on the menu. I would recommend the nourish bowl but you could probably share it with a friend if you're not that hungry.The coffee was very average. The beans I believe are Toby Estate so they were rich and strong but all of us agreed that the milk wasn't hot enough so it was a let down.I would return for food but not for coffee..",

Coffee was a bit weak especially with it being a long machiato.  More like a weak flat white.  Service was friendly and courteous and prompt.   Large indoor dining and two outdoor areas.  Rear outdoor dining also has kids play area.  Front area alfresco style dining.   Only criticism was that we had to ask for cutlery as didn't come with any and also no napkins.  No napkins on tables at all and none in sight so had to ask for some.  Took a while to come back with them and gave us one each which are very thin.  Nothing major but would have been a 5 star view otherwise",
