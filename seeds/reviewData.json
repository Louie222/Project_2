Great place to take pictures, lovely and secure kids playground. Must visit with the whole family.",

There is also a fenced small play area for the kids and an 18 hole mini golf course. The Grandies loved feeding the fish, there are hundreds of them all fighting to get the food! Great place for a special dinner or lunch or just for a snack.",

However, we went after the renovation and Iâ€™m pretty sure the rest of the reviews were related to before the renovation. Great place for kids to play and amazing gardens. Food was amazing and very friendly staff. The fish ponds were amazing and the kids loved looking at the fish. Loved it!!",
